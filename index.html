        <p>
            entreaty: to ask (a person) earnestly and seriously (to do something) Remember that
  Humans are easy to fool (especially you).
  Very few things are certain, but some things we do know.
  Science is the best tool we have for understanding the world.
  Everyone has gaps in their knowledge and understanding.
  Today&rsquo;s authority is tomorrow&rsquo;s snot-nosed kid.
  The world is full of beautiful people and interesting things.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            In the beginning was a very long time ago.
Our ancestors mucked about for six million years before modern humans evolved 200,000 years ago.
Civilization as we know it today is 6,000 years old.
The Industrial Revolution kicked into gear in the 1800s, a few hundred years ago.
Which brings us now to the cell-phones, rhinoplasty, and cat gifs that we have today.
But all is not lost. &lsquo;Hope&rsquo; is a renewable resource.

        <p>
            About time! The Church of the AsOpposedToWhat website was created with two goals in mind.
The first was to raise awareness of the abuses and problems associated with traditional organized religion. Two obvious examples are the tax exempt status of mega-churches1, and the Catholic churches reluctance to hold priests accountable when they rape little boys2.
The second goal is to introduce the idea of philosophical analysis, i.e., the love of wisdom.
