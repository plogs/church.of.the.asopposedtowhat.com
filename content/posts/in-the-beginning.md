"The church that teaches critical thinking."

 - Belief in god is not the problem. Belief without evidence is the
 problem.

 - The more certain you are, the closer you are to the dangerous edge
 of orthodoxy.

 - When you think you have the truth, you stop looking. When you stop
 looking, you no longer see. It's best not to be blinded by
 complacency.
