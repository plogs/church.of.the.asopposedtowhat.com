In the beginning was a very long time ago.

Our ancestors mucked about for six million years before modern humans
evolved 200,000 years ago.

Civilization as we know it today is 6,000 years old.

The Industrial Revolution kicked into gear in the 1800s, a few
hundred years ago.

Which brings us now to the cell-phones, rhinoplasty, and cat gifs
that we have today.

But all is not lost. 'Hope' is a renewable resource. We can still
learn to see the world in different ways.

That's the beauty of the human mind, it's ability to change and grow
and adapt to new situations.
