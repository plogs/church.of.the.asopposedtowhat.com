In the beginning was a very long time ago.

Our ancestors mucked about for six million years (6,000,000) before modern
humans evolved 200,000 years ago.

Civilization as we know it today is only 6,000 years old.

The Industrial Revolution kicked into gear in the 1800s.

Today we have cell-phones, rhinoplasty, and cat gifs.

But all is not lost. Our future looks bright.

That's the beauty of the human mind, it's ability to change and to
grow and to adapt to new situations.
