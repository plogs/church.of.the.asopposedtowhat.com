In the beginning was a very long time ago.

Our ancestors mucked about for six million years (6,000,000) before
modern humans evolved 200,000 years ago.

Civilization as we know it today is 6,000 years old.

The Industrial Revolution kicked into gear in the 1800s, a few
hundred years ago.

Which brings us to the cell-phones, rhinoplasty, and cat gifs that we
have today.

But all is not lost.  There's still hope.

Every day is a new beginning. You can still learn to see the world
in a different way.

That's the beauty of the human mind, it's ability to change and grow
and adapt to new situations.
