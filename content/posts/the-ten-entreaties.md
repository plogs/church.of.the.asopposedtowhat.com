### entreaty: to ask a person earnestly and seriously to do something

Remember that

1. Humans are easy to fool (especially you).

1. Very few things are certain, but some things we do know.

1. Science is the best tool we have for understanding the world.

1. Everyone has gaps in their knowledge and understanding.

1. Today's authority is tomorrow's snot-nosed kid.

1. The world is full of beautiful people and interesting things.

1. It's great to eat, drink and be merry, but not so much if you
   have to get up and work in the morning.

1. Before your dad's sperm met your mom's egg, that's what it was
   like to be dead.

1. All things are funny, in context.

1. Your worldview is not reality, but it does
   determine how you navigate the world. Pick a good one.

   world. Pick a good one.

1. _looks like we're missing one_

1. The person who thinks can't be fooled is the easiest person to
fool.

1. The best answer is usually: I don't know &mdash; but maybe we can
find out.
