# Ten Realizations

1. Humans are easy to fool (especially you).

1. Science is the best tool we have for understanding the world.

1. Very few things are certain, but some things we do know.

1. Today's authority is yesterday's snot-nosed kid.

1. The world is full of beautiful people and interesting things.

1. Eat, drink and be merry, but not too much if you have to get up
and work in the morning.

1. Before your dad's sperm met your mom's egg, that's what it was like to be dead.

1. All things are funny, in context.



<!--
1. The person who thinks can't be fooled is the easiest person to
fool.

1. The best answer is usually: I don't know &mdash; but maybe we can
find out.
