# About time!

The Church of the AsOpposedToWhat was created to help answer
questions about God, religion, morality, etc. For example, Does god
exist? Where does morality come from? What happens when we die?

We do provide answers to these questions, but our real goal is teach
the idea of philosophical analysis, i.e., the love of wisdom. So
ultimately you must decide on your own, you must learn to think for
yourself.



# What we believe
