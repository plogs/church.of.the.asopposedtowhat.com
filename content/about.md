# About time!

The Church of the AsOpposedToWhat website was created with two goals
in mind.

The first was to raise awareness of the abuses and problems
associated with traditional organized religion. Two obvious examples
are the tax exempt status of mega-churches, and the Catholic churches
reluctance to hold priests accountable when they rape little boys.

The second goal is to introduce the idea of philosophical analysis,
i.e., the love of wisdom.

We'll also ask and answer an assortment of questions about religion,
morality, and death. For example, Does morality exist if there is no
god? What happens when we die?

These questions are difficult to think clearly about because we
learned in school not to question authority.

But ultimately you must decide on your own, you must learn to think
for yourself.
