# About time!

The Church of the AsOpposedToWhat website was created with two goals
in mind.

The first was to raise awareness of the abuses and problems
associated with traditional organized religion. Two obvious examples
are the [tax exempt status](https://www.lsureveille.com/daily/opinion-churches-tax-exempt-status-abused-manipulated-for-political-gain/article_7af58f80-b12a-11e8-b512-174641cab06c.html) of mega-churches[^1], and the Catholic churches
reluctance to hold priests accountable [when they rape little
boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases)[^2].

The second goal is to introduce the idea of philosophical analysis,
i.e., the love of wisdom.

These goals will be accomplished by example, by asking and attemtping
to answer an assortment of questions about religion, morality, and
death. For example, Does morality exist if there is no god? What
happens when we die?

These questions are difficult for most of us to think clearly about
because we learned in school not to question authority, and we were
told that the really difficult questions, the questions about life
and meaning and purpose, could be answered if we just 'prayed on
them' hard. (Not to be confused with the Catholic preists who
preyed on them hard &mdash; *[ba-dum
ching](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Sting.ogg)*).

But ultimately you must decide on your own, you must learn to think
for yourself.
