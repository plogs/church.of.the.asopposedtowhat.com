# About time!

"The church that teaches critical thinking."

Belief in god is not the problem. Belief without evidence is the
problem.

The more certain you are, the closer you are to the dangerous edge of
orthodoxy.

When you think you have the truth, you stop looking. You are blind
but you don't know it.
