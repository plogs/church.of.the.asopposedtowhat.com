      <description>entreaty: to ask (a person) earnestly and seriously (to do something) Remember that
  Humans are easy to fool (especially you).
  Very few things are certain, but some things we do know.
  Science is the best tool we have for understanding the world.
  Everyone has gaps in their knowledge and understanding.
  Today&amp;rsquo;s authority is tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s snot-nosed kid.
  The world is full of beautiful people and interesting things.</description>

But all is not lost. &amp;lsquo;Hope&amp;rsquo; is a renewable resource.</description>

The second goal is to introduce the idea of philosophical analysis, i.e., the love of wisdom.</description>
