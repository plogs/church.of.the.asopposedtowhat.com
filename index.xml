      <description>&amp;ldquo;The church that teaches critical thinking.&amp;rdquo;
  Belief in god is not the problem. Belief without evidence is the problem.
  The more certain you are, the closer you are to the dangerous edge of orthodoxy.
  When you think you have the truth, you stop looking. When you stop looking, you no longer see. It&amp;rsquo;s best not to be blinded by complacency.

      <description>The Ten Truths   Humans are easy to fool (especially you).
  Science is the best tool we have for understanding the world.
  Very few things are certain, but some things we do know.
  Today&amp;rsquo;s authority is yesterday&amp;rsquo;s snot-nosed kid.
  The world is full of beautiful people and interesting things.
  The person who thinks he&amp;rsquo;s not being fooled is the easiest person to fool.</description>

      <description>About time! &amp;ldquo;The church that teaches critical thinking.&amp;rdquo;
Belief in god is not the problem. Belief without evidence is the problem.
The more certain you are, the closer you are to the dangerous edge of orthodoxy.
When you think you have the truth, you stop looking. You are blind but you don&amp;rsquo;t know it.</description>
