      <description>In the beginning was a very long time ago.
Our ancestors mucked about for six million years (6,000,000) before modern humans evolved 200,000 years ago.
Civilization as we know it today is 6,000 years old.
The Industrial Revolution kicked into gear in the 1800s, a few hundred years ago.
Which brings us to the cell-phones, rhinoplasty, and cat gifs that we have today.
But all is not lost. There&amp;rsquo;s still hope.</description>

      <description>Ten Realizations   Humans are easy to fool (especially you).

  Today&amp;rsquo;s authority soon becomes yesterday&amp;rsquo;s snot-nosed kid.
  The world is full of beautiful people and interesting things.
  Eat, drink and be merry, but not too much if you have to get up and work in the morning.</description>

      <description>About time! The Church of the AsOpposedToWhat website was created with two goals in mind.
The first was to raise awareness of the abuses and problems associated with traditional organized religion. Two obvious examples are the tax exempt status of mega-churches1, and the Catholic churches reluctance to hold priests accountable when they rape little boys2.
The second goal is to introduce the idea of philosophical analysis, i.e., the love of wisdom.</description>
