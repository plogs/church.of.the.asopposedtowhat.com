        <p>
            In the beginning was a very long time ago.
Our ancestors mucked about for six million years (6,000,000) before modern humans evolved 200,000 years ago.
Civilization as we know it today is 6,000 years old.
The Industrial Revolution kicked into gear in the 1800s, a few hundred years ago.
Which brings us to the cell-phones, rhinoplasty, and cat gifs that we have today.
But all is not lost. There&rsquo;s still hope.

        <p>
            Ten Realizations   Humans are easy to fool (especially you).
  Science is the best tool we have for understanding the world.
  Very few things are certain, but some things we do know.
  Today&rsquo;s authority soon becomes yesterday&rsquo;s snot-nosed kid.
  The world is full of beautiful people and interesting things.
  Eat, drink and be merry, but not too much if you have to get up and work in the morning.
