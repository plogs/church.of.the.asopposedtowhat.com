      <description>entreaty: to ask (a person) earnestly and seriously (to do something) Remember that
  Humans are easy to fool (especially you).
  Very few things are certain, but some things we do know.
  Science is the best tool we have for understanding the world.
  Everyone has gaps in their knowledge and understanding.
  Today&amp;rsquo;s authority is tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s snot-nosed kid.
  The world is full of beautiful people and interesting things.</description>

      <description>In the beginning was a very long time ago.
Our ancestors mucked about for six million years before modern humans evolved 200,000 years ago.
Civilization as we know it today is 6,000 years old.
The Industrial Revolution kicked into gear in the 1800s, a few hundred years ago.
Which brings us now to the cell-phones, rhinoplasty, and cat gifs that we have today.
But all is not lost. &amp;lsquo;Hope&amp;rsquo; is a renewable resource.</description>
