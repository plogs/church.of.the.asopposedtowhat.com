		<h1 id="about-time">About time!</h1>
<p>The Church of the AsOpposedToWhat website was created with two goals
in mind.</p>
<p>The first was to raise awareness of the abuses and problems
associated with traditional organized religion. Two obvious examples
are the tax exempt status of mega-churches, and the Catholic churches
reluctance to hold priests accountable when they rape little boys.</p>
<p>The second goal is to introduce the idea of philosophical analysis,
i.e., the love of wisdom.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also ask and answer an assortment of questions about religion,
morality, and death. For example, Does morality exist if there is no
god? What happens when we die?</p>
<p>These questions are difficult to think clearly about because we
learned in school not to question authority.</p>
<p>But ultimately you must decide on your own, you must learn to think
for yourself.</p>
